# Master-Thesis-R-scripts

This repository contains data analysis and figures from my Master's thesis on Implications of coastal darkening for marine protist diversity and size structure in Lyngdalfjorden, Norway
Environmental and sequencing data were collected during field work in 2024 across six locations in Lyngdalsfjorden. Sequencing was done using 18S rRNA metabarcoding (V4 region).

## Contents

- **Trophic mode assignment**  
  Script used to assign trophic strategies (e.g., phototrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic) to protist taxa based on literature and reference lists.

- **LICOR Tidying**  
  Data cleaning and formatting of light data collected from the LICOR sensor.

- **Figures for environmental variables**  
  Visualization of seasonal and spatial trends in environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients).

- **Figures for DNA, trophic modes and size structure**  
  Plots showing variation in diversity, trophic modes, and size structure of protist communities.

- **Descriptive statistics and statistical analysis for DNA and size structure**  
  Summary statistics and statistical models used to test effects on diversity and size based on metabarcoding and microscopy.

- **Descriptive statistics for environmental data**  
  Summary descriptive statistics of environmental measurements.

- **DADA2 and assigning taxonomy**  
  Script for quality filtering, ASV inference, and taxonomic assignment using the DADA2 pipeline and PR2 database.

- **CTD Tidying**  
  Data wrangling and formatting of CTD profile data (e.g., temperature, salinity, oxygen).

- **CDOM analysis and figures**  
  Analysis of CDOM concentrations, light attenuation, and relationships with ecological variables, including figures.
